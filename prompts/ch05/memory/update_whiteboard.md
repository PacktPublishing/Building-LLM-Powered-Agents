Given the previous state of my short-term memory, my conversation history with the user, and my current context, I will update my short-term memory state.

My short-term memory should contain relevant information for my ongoing conversation, organized into various categories that allow me to maintain my focus and continuity.

[PREVIOUS SHORT-TERM MEMORY STATE]
{{previous_state}}

[CONVERSATION HISTORY]
{{message_history}}

[CURRENT CONTEXT]
{{context}}

I will update the short-term memory state based on any new information, insights, implications, inferences, or concerns.

I'll add, modify, or remove information as necessary.

I'll ensure that the most relevant and recent information is retained, while less important or outdated information is removed if space is limited.

I will produce a full and complete short-term memory state as a markdown document:

[NEWSHORT-TERM MEMORY STATE]
